> ## What is DenoORM

Not to be redudant, DenoORM is an [ORM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-how-does-it-work-and-how-should-i-use-one) that acts as almost a wrapper for your database flavor (MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, etc.).

To run the **non-functioning** test:

```ts
deno run -c tsconfig.json index.ts
```
